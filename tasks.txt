The "simple" tasks
 * Optimise
 * Refactor
 * Preprocessor
   - expand macros (under work)
   - include files
   - etc?
 * Token list
   - improve the variable id for class member variables
   - simplify "void f(x) int x; {" into "void f(int x) {"
   - etc?
 * Add unit tests
 * improved error message handling
 * Perhaps the parseArgs function should be moved to the class Settings instead?

New checks (bugs)
 * CheckMemoryLeak
   - Check for more resource leaks
     Windows API (CreatePen, GetDC, ..)

New checks (style)
 * data truncation
 * unused static functions or variables
