  I think this needs to be handled better.




Unused function / variable

  If the user provides "--recursive" there should be
  warnings for unused functions and variables.

  Check if all members in the public section of a class
  are used externally.




Dead pointers

  Check for dead pointers



Buffer overruns

  When writing to struct members



Style

  Increase constness

  Function parameters: Use std::ostream instead of std::ostringstream or std::ofstream

  Optimisation: Return "const _T &" instead of "_T"?

  Function parameters: Better with "const _T *" or "const _T &" than "_T"

  Unused variable (function, file, class), unused value, unused parameter




MEMORY LEAKS
============

  Allow the user to specify classes to be ignored (that have garbage collection)

  Allow the user to specify allocation and free functions (kmalloc, kfree)

  Better checking of pointers in structs
