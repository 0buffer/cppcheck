  I think the SimplifyTokens function should insert braces after every if/for/while.
  That would make the token list easier to parse.

  class TOKEN!



Userdefined types

  I think this needs to be handled better.




Unused function / variable

  Check if all members in the public section of a class
  are used externally.




Dead pointers

  Check for dead pointers



Style

  Increase constness

  Function parameters: Use std::ostream instead of std::ostringstream or std::ofstream

  Optimisation: Return "const _T &" instead of "_T"?

  Unused variable (function, file, class), unused value, unused parameter




MEMORY LEAKS
============

  Better checking of pointers in structs
